This classic metal spring toy walks downstairs, alone or in pairs, and makes a slink-ity sound. First invented by mechanical engineer Richard James in 1943 during an experiment with tension coils. James accidentally dropped a spring on the floor and watched as it began to “walk.” Two years later, he introduced his walking spring toy in Gimbels Department Store during Christmas, and the Slinky immediately sold out. Since its debut, over 300 million Slinkys have been sold worldwide. In 2000, this classic toy was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame. Made 75 years ago, Slinky continues to be a favorite toy of children and adults all over the world. Slinky is fun for a girl or a boy and makes an ideal gift, stocking stuffer, prize, or present. Everyone loves a Slinky! Ages 5+',

This starkness was matched in brevity, with Pink Moon consisting of 11 short songs coming to less than half-an-hour of music. Though critically well received at the time, commercial success did not arrive till nearly 30 years later, when 30 seconds of 'Pink Moon' was used in a Volkswagen commercial.`,
